        Secretary’s note: All the song numbers in these minutes refer to pages
        of the twenty-sixth edition of The Harmonia Sacra. If a singer selects a
        song and chooses not to lead it, the requester is named parenthetically
        in these minutes, followed by the name of the leader (if there be one)
        and the number of the page where the song may be found. — SWS
